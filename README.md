# A-200-Checker
This script displays a small notification at the bottom right corner telling you when A-200 has spawned.
The A-200 despawning sound is still in-game and doesn't need a notification telling when he despawns.
Might change to make a sound play rather than a notification...

## Note
These scripts will not be updated much because of how simple they are and don't need to be changed
